By heating up a gas (air), the pressure will go up, and/or the volume will get bigger.
When cooling a gas, the pressure wil go down, and/or the volume will get smaler.
If you compress air, it will get hot, if you expand air, it cools. (fridge/heat-pump).

The Stirling engine takes advantage of the differences in temperature, by using heat to expand air, and cold to contract air.
By storing the heat(/cold) into a regenerator (iron-wire for example), just like in a heat exchanger, by letting the media (hot and/or cold) going into each others directions, against each other, the used heat/cold is used again.
The system only looses heat when the air expands, when its converted into electricity, and it only looses some cold then the air is shrinking and also this is turned into energy.
The lost cold/heat is then supplied by the heat/cold storage again.
Now, when the sun comes up, the land and air gets heated, the air expands, you don't notice. With 1 bar, = 1 kg / square cm = 10 tons / square meter.
Then when it gets hotter, more and more heat is radiated back into space. You don't notice. All this heat, energy, is lost.
Then during night the heat radiates into space, you don't notice, except for it cools down, the air cools down, shrinks, but you don't notice. Then water evaporates. Lots of. You see clouds and you get rain. You get wind. Just a tiny part of all energy....
Also lots of water is converted into gas, giving you some nice clouds. Imagine how much gas it would take to evaporate so much water... This energy is also gone.... You don't notice, you only see clouds, don't you?
By doing this contraction of air, and expansion of air in a closed vessel, you can use the pressure to generate energy. Heating up -> pressure -> energy, cooling down -> under pressure (=pressure of atmosphere) -> energy.
During day time you can store ALL HEAT FROM SUN/AIR. Into the ground, were there is lots of.
During night time you can USE ALL COLD FROM ALL AIR. And the heat from the storage. 
By taking the heat from the storage, you put the cold in. The cold from the storage is then used during day time, against the heat from the air and sun. And the storage is filled up with heat from the other side.
So you have lots of hot air from day/sun/air.
You have lots of cold during night.
You have lots of cold during day from storage.
You have lots of heat during night from storage.
All this heat and cold from air/sun/storage/night can be used to generate cheap green energy.
The storage works like a heat exchanger, just like the regenerator (just metal to store heat/cold).
Then the system also runs with a heat exchanger, where cold air is heated up, and hot air is cooled down, and where the hot and cold air is regenerated/reused to pre-heat and pre-cool the cool / hot air.
The maximum amount of energy you can get out of the heat, is like 33% of the difference in heat between day/night.
If you heat up 1 cc of water, 1 degree, you need 1 calorie.
1 calorie = 4.18 joule.
1 joule = 1 watt * 1 second.
For heating up 1 liter of water, 1000 cc, you need 4180 watt seconds. Plusminus (/3600) 1.2 watt hour.
For heating up 1000 liters of water, 1 cubic meter, you need like 1.2 kilo watt hour. (KWh).
For heating up 1000 liters of water 10 degrees, you need 12 kilo watt hour.
For heating up 1 cubic meter of earth (avg.weight 5.0) 10 degrees you need 12 * 5 = 60 kilo watt hour.
For heating up 100 x 100 x 100 cubic meters of earth, you need 60 million KWh. Like 60 Gigawatt hour.
Doing this during whole day, 24 hours, you need like 2.2 Gigawatt continuously.
So when you only get 10% efficiency, you can get like 0.22 Gigawatt continuously. Like 220 Megawatt continuously.
Just by storing the heat/cold 100 meters deep, on a plant 100 times 100 meters.
You only suck up hot air during day, and blow air out little colder. Change in temperature -> energy.
You only suck up cold air during night, and blow air out little warmer. Change in temperature -> energy.
On a plant like 1 x 1 kilometer, storing the heat and cold 1 kilometer deep, you get like 220 Gigawatt continuously plant.
Costs: Heat exchangers (just metal), turbines and/or pumps, holes into the ground with pipes.
Also by storing the heat during summer, and getting the cold out during summer to cool (airco),
and using the heat to heat during winter, and meanwhile store the cold for using it in the summer, 
and meanwhile generate energy with it. Green. No pollution.
Its like tapping all heat that during day time just expands the air, and radiates back into space, without doing 'work', let it work, and storing it, and use it all during night, to also do work.
You need a hot and cold side. When heat is flowing from hot to cold, it can do work. Other way around needs energy/work, like fridge. (cold inside, hot on backside).
And there is a lot of heat (air) during daytime, and a lot of cold (air) during night time. And the storage is endless. It all waits to get harvested.
Think of heating up the air in a air balloon, it expands, then its lighter than the surrounding air, capable of lifting a few humans into the air.
Because of the weight -> pressure of air.
Now, everywhere were heat is released into the air, so the air expands (all open fire's, sun heat/light), and the energy is gone.
Temperature in space is even lower, like 273 degrees below zero on the shadow side of like the moon. There is even more energy to harvest.
You also can use a pipeline against a mountain. Letting the hot flued go up, and the cooled flued (heavier) going down. Like butane, it vaporizes (boils) above 0 degrees Celsius, and condenses below 0.
Then the gas explodes in the valley, because of the heat, and condenses in the mountain, were its below zero. A big turbine in between does the rest. Its so simple.
Same way people build houses with bricks, backed with gas from clay. The clay is rocks to dust from the mountains. Why not use bricks from the mountains to build houses? Then houses would last forever, and costs nothing.
80% of everything is energy, fossils. Who owns and sells the fossils, makes all money. With all (generated) money, they harvested with energy, they can buy the planet 40 times. When the rich release just 2.5% of their money, there would be so much money, money would be worthless. Prices would skyrocket. Then money ain't worth anything, so these rich never can spend that money. They only use it to stay into power.
The beans in the can costs 2 cents. The rest is energy(profit) profit (more) and taxes. With the created misery they use taxes to create jobs in the misery industry, for people who can't do anything and/or are lazy, and vote for the system to continue. Because without the system they would be workless, because there is no misery, and everything is for free.
What could you do with endless amounts of free cheap clean energy?
Like almost everything?
But then the voting sheep who work in the system-created misery industry have to clean their own toilets....
This/these techniques exists/are known for over 200 years. (Stirling engine / heat engine / thermodynamics / slavery by energy).
